" ctrlp_bdelete.vim: An extension to ctrlp.vim for closing buffers.
"
" To use this plugin, install it with Vundle or Pathogen, then add
"   call ctrlp_bdelete#init()
" to your ~/.vimrc to initialize the ctrlp settings.
"
" When installed, you can use <C-@> in the ctrlp finder to delete open
" buffers. This also works for buffers marked with <C-z>.
